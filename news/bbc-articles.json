The study is the latest piece of research by historians seeking to undermine the claims of The Technology of Orgasm \u2013 and its holds on both the history of sexuality and the popular imagination.", "\u201cFrom what I knew of the history of sexuality, it sounded unlikely that doctors would be doing this,\u201d says Hallie Lieberman, a historian of technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and one of the paper\u2019s authors. \u201cWhen I checked the [book\u2019s] sources, that was when I first really thought, okay, there\u2019s something up with this.\u201d", "\n\n        View image of Mechanical vibrators like this one were used to cure women of hysteria \n    ", "Lieberman proposes an alternative view. Yes, mechanical devices known as \u2018vibrators\u2019 \u2013 and advertised as back or neck massagers \u2013 were being used by women in intimate ways as early as the 1900s and 1910s. But there\u2019s no evidence that that was the case prior to 1900, when vibrators were being marketed to physicians, not directly to consumers.", "And it certainly wasn\u2019t the case that doctors, unaware of what the female orgasm really was, were using these devices to cure women of their hysteria.", "Origin myth", "Stretching back into the 1800s, electric vibrators were heavily marketed in magazines, periodicals, medical literature and newspapers.", "In one advert from around 1904, a woman sits relaxed, her head slightly to one side. A business-like doctor in a long white coat stands behind her, touching her neck. Strapped to one of his hands is a metal device with a thick black cable: an electrical vibrator, designed to ease the strain of massaging patients. But there is no sign in the image that the device is to be used anywhere other than the patient\u2019s neck.", "\u201cBy this method 50 per cent of the fatigue to masseuses, inseparable from the usual manual massage, is avoided,\u201d says the flyer. \u201cInfinitely better results in treatment are obtained.\u201d", "In another leaflet, the treatment is administered not by a doctor but by the patient herself. Shaped like a hairdryer, the Sanofix vibrator from around 1913 came in a small wooden box, complete with several different attachments.

That\u2019s why it took me 19 years and eventually I wrote a book.\u201d", " Maines wrote that doctors had been using masturbation to treat hysteria in women even as far back as Roman times ", "The Technology of Orgasm outlined her theory of how vibrators came to be used as labour-saving devices for orgasmic hysteria treatment, carried out by hard-working physicians aiming to treat as many patients as possible. Maines wrote that doctors had been using masturbation to treat hysteria in women even as far back as the Romans. Doctors would provide relief from this condition by inducing \u2018paroxysms\u2019 in the women through masturbation. But because of a poor understanding of female sexuality, the doctors were not aware that the paroxysms their patients were experiencing were in fact a sexual response.", "Sex ed", "Female sexuality may not have got as much attention as male sexuality historically, but the idea that Victorian-era doctors would have done this out of a complete lack of knowledge seems a little far-fetched to Lieberman.", "\u201cShe presents it as though no one is aware that it\u2019s an orgasm,\u201d Lieberman says. \u201cBut there was an awareness of the clitoris and women\u2019s sexuality at the time.\u201d", " In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, there was general awareness of the female orgasm ", "There is evidence that in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, for example, doctors in the US and the UK theorised about what kinds of sexual behaviours in women were healthy and which were not, and there was general awareness of the female orgasm.", "Then there are problems with the historical examples cited in Maines\u2019s book.

Another problem was that Maines didn\u2019t distinguish between satirical writing from this period and genuine medical literature.", "\u201cA Roman satire, describing \u2018anointers\u2019 at the baths who masturbate a woman to orgasm, is very different from saying doctors really\u00a0did this,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s a satire \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to be outrageous.\u201d", "In contrast, ancient medical texts that described doctors massaging the lower back, knees or head were misread by Maines as a rather different kind of massage, according to King. Maines got around the contrary evidence by cherry-picking phrases and sources deliberately, King says: \u201cfor example, by reading a description about what happens when the womb is rubbed during intercourse and making that into a passage about masturbation by a doctor.\u201d", "Real deal", "But if not doctors, then who actually invented the vibrator as a sex toy?", "The answer goes back to some of the adverts that Maines found \u2013 even if some academics today find her interpretations of them to be specious.", "When doctors began to realise around the early 20th Century that vibrators were in fact not the cure-alls they were taken to be, the manufacturers of these devices were left with a problem. There was a whole industry devoted to making these devices: there had been the hand-cranked version, which evolved into steam-powered models, which in turn evolved into electrically powered devices. But now, there were fewer doctors keen to buy them. \u00a0", "One company made a bold move in 1903, releasing an advert for the Hygeia sexual appliance for men and women.", "\u201cIt kind of looked like this belt with electricity and vibration,\u201d says Lieberman.", " Obscenity laws prevented companies from advertising devices for sexual pleasure for many years ", "This was the earliest source of a vibrator associated with sex that Lieberman discovered in her research. But openly selling a vibrator as a sexual appliance was rare, not least because it was considered obscene. In the US, the UK and elsewhere, obscenity laws prevented companies from advertising devices for sexual pleasure for many years.", "This shift towards selling vibrators straight to consumers was strengthened in 1915 when the American Medical Association made a public statement that marked vibrators for medical use out to be \u201ca delusion and a snare\u201d. Any effect they had on patients was psychological and not medical.", "\u201cThe association classified vibrators as a health fraud and a quack device,\u201d says Lieberman. \u201cThey started collecting these ads that people would send in to them, and they\u2019d write back and say no, it\u2019s a fraud.\u201d", "Rather than killing the vibrator industry, the manufacturers simply continued their shift in focus from doctors to consumers.", "\n\n        View image of A mid-20th Century ad says that the \u2018mini vibrator... soothes you to pleasant relaxation\u2019 \n    ", "\u201cYou would see ads in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and all over the UK, too,\u201d says Lieberman. \u201cThey were seen as a home appliance for leisurely women, showing them having a massage during the day.\u201d", "As time went on, these adverts became more or less subtly sexualised. Shirtless men and women in low-cut blouses would be shown happily displaying the vibrators. Because of the coyness around advertising vibrators explicitly as sex toys, it\u2019s hard to pin down when they were first widely known to be used as such.", " The kind of vibrator that we think of today started showing up in the 1950s and became more common and openly sold in the 1960s \u2013 Lieberman ", "\u201cThe kind of vibrator that we think of today started showing up in the 1950s and became more common and openly sold in the 1960s,\u201d says Lieberman. \u201cBut it was still controversial.\u201d", "The controversy took a long time to subside.

I have a lot of company in thinking that,\u201d says Maines.", "Lieberman admits that the evidence she uncovered makes for a slightly less catchy story than the original hypothesis of countless generations of doctors using masturbation to appease hysterical women, alighting on the mechanised vibrator to ease their aching wrists.", "\u201c[That story] just appeals to people now,\u201d adds King. \u201cIt\u2019s like some porn movie scenario with the doctor that \u2013 nudge, nudge \u2013 knows what the problem really is.\u201d", "It is this appeal that has led the influence of this theory of medical masturbation grow quite so far.

", "The results of the US mid-term elections continues the theme of stark division seen in recent political outcomes around the world. Not only are the US House of Representatives and Senate now controlled by different parties but the early analysis shows a series of very close races driven by gaps between rural, suburban and urban areas, ethnicity and economic position.\u00a0", "Barack Obama echoed this theme in a recent\u00a0rare intervention\u00a0into the public debate in the US to highlight how worried he feels about the threats to democracy and progress posed by increasing economic inequality, and how this drives social divisions.", " Our misperceptions of reality are partly emotional, simple 'myth-busting' will not really help that much, because it misdiagnoses the cause ", "In my opinion, he\u2019s right to be worried. The concentration of wealth at the top really has grown. And not just in the US. In 2017, for the first time since we\u2019ve had reliable wealth measurement drawn from national statistics, the top 1% wealthiest people in the world owned more than the rest of the population put together.", "But when survey researchers ask people to guess what proportion of the wealth the top 1% in their respective countries own, they\u2019re often way out, as seen in Ipsos\u2019 Perils of Perception studies.", "Click or pinch to zoom on mobile.", "Britain and France were the worst at guessing. The actual proportion of wealth owned by the top 1% in both countries is the same, at 23%. But Brits thought the top 1% owned 59% of wealth while the French thought it was 56%.", "Although people in some surprising countries did underestimate this concentration of wealth. The average guess in Russia was that the top 1% own 53% of the wealth, which is actually not that different from the guess in the UK and France.\u00a0 But the reality is far worse, the top 1% in Russia actually own an extraordinary 70% of the country\u2019s wealth, three times the level of the UK and France.", "The US also stands out as one of the most unequal coun\u00adtries for wealth distribution among the rich nations included in the study, with the top 1% owning 37% of the country\u2019s wealth, but with the guess again less optimistic, similar to France and the UK, at 57%", "So, why are we so out of kilter with reality?", "A big part of the explanation lies in our emotional reaction, rather than our lack of knowledge of the facts.\u00a0", "Like Obama, we know inequality is a growing issue, and we hear regular, vivid anecdotes of excess running alongside stories of the real poverty experienced by many, so our guesses can become exaggerated. Whether we\u2019re entirely conscious of it or not, we\u2019re partly sending a message that this is a big and worrying issue: inequality looms large in our minds, so we literally inflate the figures.\u00a0", "Social psychologists have a term for this phenomenon, they label it: \u2018emotional innumeracy\u2019. This means that when we ask people to guess at the scale of an issue, cause and effect run in both directions: we\u2019re not just worried about things that we think are big issues, we exaggerate the scale of issues that we\u2019re already worried about.\u00a0", "Emotional innumeracy points to a vital conclusion: because our misperceptions of reality are partly emotional, simple \u201cmyth-busting\u201d \u2013 telling people they\u2019re wrong on the facts \u2013 will not really help that much, because it misdiagnoses the cause.\u00a0 Our misperceptions are often not about ignorance, but more about a world view driven by our underlying attitudes and beliefs.\u00a0", "We also asked people what they thought the top 1% should own, and this reveals some fascinating patterns.", "First, people are mostly not calling for complete equality of wealth \u2013 with the averages running from people saying the top 1% should have 14% of wealth in Israel to 32% in China.", "Some people in all countries do want complete wealth parity though \u2013 and Britain is highest on this: 19% of Brits said the top 1% should only have 1%, followed closely by Russia, where 18 % said they should only have 1%.", "Click or pinch to zoom on mobile.", "But, second, if we go back to the averages of what we say inequality should be and compare that with the actual level, something immediately jumps out: on the surface, people seem pretty comfortable with the current state of wealth inequality in many countries.", "For example, the French said the top 1% should own 27%, when they actually \u2018only\u2019 currently own 23%. A simplistic reading of this is that the French \u2013 a country that has \u2018\u00e9galit\u00e9\u2019 (equality) as part of its national strapline \u2013 are saying give the wealthiest a bit more. ", " Inequality looms large in our minds, so we literally inflate the figures. ", "Of course, that\u2019s the completely wrong interpretation.", "We know from our question on how people see the \u2018reality\u2019, that the French on average thought the top 1% currently own 56% of the country\u2019s wealth. So, what they\u2019re really saying is that the very wealthy should have about half what they currently have.", "This points to a key benefit of understanding our many misperceptions on finances and wealth: we need to know what people think the current situation is before we ask them what they think it should be. Or, the other way round: not knowing how wrong are about realities can lead us to very wrong conclusions about what we should do.", "--", "To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.", "If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features\u00a0newsletter\u00a0called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

When he finishes, he clambers up the scaffolding and uses rope to hoist the 20-sq-m canvases three storeys into the air to hang them on the theatre\u2019s facade.", "Today, the Chin Men is the only remaining theatre in Taiwan to continue the age-old tradition of displaying hand-painted film posters. And\u00a0in an era of digital printing and computerised billboards, Yan\u00a0is one of the last artists in the world carrying on a craft that\u2019s on the verge of extinction.", "On a recent afternoon, Yan toiled away in the sweltering heat as a stream of pedestrians breezed by the ageing artist. With the precision of an architect and the flair of an Impressionist, Yan patiently sketched over last week\u2019s work with a line-ruled grid before bringing Tom Cruise to life for the new Mission: Impossible film.", "With each sweeping stoke, the slight man with eyeglasses began filling the giant canvas with billowing explosions, snow-capped peaks and larger-than-life heroes, villains and sidekicks.

When silent films became popular in the 1910s, theatres around the world hired artists to convey the excitement of new releases and capture an audience\u2019s attention before they even stepped into the theatre. By the 1940s, Hollywood studios began printing and shipping their painted posters around the globe. But in many places where skilled labour remained cheaper than billboard-sized prints, handmade paintings continued to adorn cinemas for decades to come.", "In India, Bollywood employed 300 artists to decorate the country\u2019s theatres with dramatic renderings of princesses and maharajahs for much of the 20th Century. In Ghana, local artists painted movie posters on flour sacks that could be rolled up and taken to the next screening until the 1990s. And in Thailand, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and the Philippines, artists scaled bamboo ladders to paint stills of films\u2019 most memorable scenes and characters until the late 1990s.", "But perhaps nowhere did this artistic tradition run deeper than in Taiwan, where gigantic oil-painted posters were once some of the most eye-grabbing sights on the island\u2019s streets.\u00a0", "During the heyday of kung-fu movies in the 1970s, we had more than 700 theatres in the country, and almost every one employed its own artist. Now, Mr Yan is the last. He is a very important treasure of Taiwanese cinema,\u201d said Chen Pin-Chuan, director of the Taiwan Film Institute.", "Shy and softly spoken, Yan has always worked alone. It takes him two to three days to complete a painting, and \u2018it all starts with the face.\u2019 If he likes the film\u2019s digitally printed poster, he\u2019ll recreate it in a massive, dream-like portrait. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll sit in the front of the empty theatre and watch the movie. Then, he\u2019ll carry six canvas panels that each dwarf him out into the natural light and blend his own style with the film\u2019s plot to \u2018try to honour it in a new way.\u2019", "Having never married, Yan views painting as his life partner and pours himself into each portrait. Yet, while the Chin Men\u2019s paint-splashed marquee has become one of Tainan\u2019s most popular attractions, for many years the paint-speckled artist working across the street went unrecognised and unnoticed.", "\u201cOften when people pass by, they look at me and don\u2019t believe I painted these. It makes me feel sad,\u201d Yan said. \u201cBut when I see children look up at the theatre and get excited, I\u2019m reminded of myself as a child and I smile.\u201d", "Yan (pictured in this self-portrait) grew up in a strict household on Tainan\u2019s outskirts. He remembers studying film ads in the newspaper as a nine year old and recreating them with chalk. By 13, he was spending more time in Tainan\u2019s cinemas than its classrooms \u2013 sometimes watching seven films a day and going home to sketch his favourite scenes from memory. When he finally told his parents at age 18 that he wanted to become a film artist\u2019s apprentice, they chased him out of the house with a broom.", "\u201cThey said I\u2019d starve,\u201d he remembered. \u201cAnd they were right.\u201d", "Yan apprenticed under one of Taiwan\u2019s greatest billboard masters, Chen Feng Yun. For the first two years, he earned the equivalent of just $6 per month, surviving on soup and rice and sleeping in the theatre because he couldn\u2019t afford to rent a flat. Instead of instructing Yan, the master merely let Yan observe him as he worked. Yan studied how the master gripped his brushes, memorised his colour combinations and practiced relentlessly. Then one day, something clicked.", "\u201cEverything has an essence, and you have to understand the subject\u2019s essence to bring it to life,\u201d Yan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the blending of light and shadow, the person\u2019s eyes and the angles that make it come alive.\u201d", "Soon Yan began begging his teacher for work, and whenever the master had too many commissions, he\u2019d hand extra projects off to Yan. During the peak of Taiwan\u2019s film industry in the 1970s, Yan hand-painted a staggering 100 to 200 billboards a month. Yet, in 1983 \u2013 13 years and thousands of billboards after Yan first entered the master\u2019s studio \u2013 a theatre manager revealed to Yan that the master had been passing all of Yan\u2019s paintings off as his own for the past decade.", "\u201cI felt so taken advantage of, so invisible,\u201d Yan said. \u201cFor many years, I received no credit for my work. But when the managers learned that I was the one behind all the paintings, I started working for every theatre in Tainan.\u201d", "In recent decades, the rise of DVDs, on-demand streaming and multiplex cinema chains has caused many old theatres in Taiwan to shut their doors. That, along with the cheap cost of mass-produced prints, has forced those that have survived to abandon the tradition of hand-painted posters.", "Today, only a handful of theatres around the world still employ a full-time poster artist: there\u2019s one in Germany, one in Greece and one in the Philippines. And in Tainan, which once employed more than 30 full-time poster masters at the start of the 1980s, the Chin Men Theater has been Yan\u2019s last and only client for the past 26 years.", "\u201cThere has always been a hand-painted artist here and so it\u2019s important that this culture doesn\u2019t disappear, like it has everywhere else,\u201d said the Chin Men\u2019s manager, Wu Jyun-Cheng. \u201cIn the malls now, they use computers to print posters, but it looks dull and dead. Master Yan\u2019s art is vivid and alive.\u201d", "Not much has changed at the Chin Men since Wu\u2019s father opened it in 1950. Instead of computer-generated tickets, a teller still stamps each entry by hand. Inside, a sign politely asks men to remove their caps and an arrow points people downstairs to the air-raid shelter. Outside, Wu\u2019s brother drives an old lorry through the streets, advertising the theatre\u2019s latest releases with a bullhorn. And throughout the lobby, framed portraits of hometown hero and director Ang Lee serve as a shrine to the Chin Men\u2019s most famous patron.", "\u201cIt was this theatre where Ang Lee first fell in love with cinema as a young student, and he\u2019s always said that the painted billboards were a big part of that attraction,\u201d Wu said. \u201cWe are committed to keeping this tradition alive for as long as Master Yan is able.\u201d", "In the past year, images of Yan\u2019s hand-painted posters have started circulating online. After working in the shadow of his famous master for so long, the once-anonymous artist has begun receiving praise from people he\u2019s never met \u2013 including one Hollywood legend who Yan has spent much of his lifetime emulating.", "\u201cI am completely amazed by this man\u2019s wonderful work,\u201d said artist Drew Struzan, who has designed more than 150 hand-painted film posters \u2013 including ET the Extra-Terrestrial and the Indiana Jones, Back to the Future and Star Wars series. \u201cThe sheer scale he\u2019s working with, the energy and passion he has, it\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen anyone doing anything like this.\u201d", "While Yan continues to fight his lonely battle against digital printing one brushstroke at a time, the Chin Men Theater can only afford so many canvases. As a result, with each new film release, Yan has to paint over his old work and lose it forever \u2013 but not before snapping a photo of it hanging the theatre\u2019s facade as a final keepsake.", "A lifetime of painting has also exacted a punishing toll on his eyesight. Years ago, doctors discovered severe injuries to his retinas, and while they were able to repair his left eye, he has lost nearly all sight in the right. Surely, if a little more slowly these days, Yan soldiers on, insisting, \u201cI\u2019ll paint until I can no longer see.\u201d", "Since the last of his contemporaries abandoned the profession years ago, Yan recognises that Taiwan\u2019s hand-painted cinema tradition is likely to disappear with his eyesight. So, after nearly 50 years of immortalising stars, Yan has spent the past four years instructing students.", "Now, every weekend a group of 10 to 15 apprentices eagerly wait in a car parking across from the Chen Men Theater until their master arrives on his rattling purple scooter. Armed with easels, chalk and paint, Yan patiently teaches the group how to carve a canvas into triangle grids, how to mix five cans of paint into thousands of colours and how to search in a subject\u2019s eyes to find their \u2018essence\u2019. He\u2019s not sure if any of his pupils will follow in his footsteps, but he\u2019s quick to impart a lesson he learned from struggling anonymously under his own master long ago.", "\u201cDon\u2019t give up, don\u2019t get discouraged,\u201d Yan said, looking up at the theatre\u2019s hand-painted canvases. \u201cEvery new film is a chance to capture someone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "Custom Made is a BBC Travel series that introduces you to custodians of cultural traditions all around the world.", "Here, women can have many or as few lovers as they wish", "\u2018It\u2019s as Irish as potatoes\u2019", "The show-stopping technique could be on the verge of disappearing", "Its story is perhaps even more remarkable than its architecture", "\n\n"]},

There are no passengers using it.", "Germany may be known for its efficiency and refined engineering, but when it comes to Berlin\u2019s new ghost airport this reputation could not be further from the truth. Plagued by comically long delays, perpetually mismanaged and expected to cost more than three and a half times the initial budget, the airport has become something of a running joke among Berliners - and a source of frustration for local politicians, business leaders and residents alike.", "\u00a0\n\n        View image of (Credit: Getty Images)\n    ", "The city, state and federally funded airport was originally expected to cost \u20ac2bn. Earlier this year, however, planners said the current estimated costs would reach \u20ac7.3bn, a number that could rise further depending on how long it takes to finish. And every month the airport sits unopened, it racks up millions of euros in maintenance and upkeep costs.", "\u201cThere was, in a sense, a spiral of major errors which contributed to the final result,\u201d Jobst Fiedler, a professor emeritus at Berlin\u2019s Hertie School of Governance and the author of a 2015 case study on the airport, told BBC Capital. \u201cIt should have opened in June 2012 - at that time already there was a considerable cost and time overrun - but the story has been going on.\u201d", "Planning for the new airport began after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. At the time, it became clear that the newly-reunified capital would need a modern airport with far greater capacity than its pair of Cold War-era airports, Tegel (in former West Berlin) and Sch\u00f6nefeld (in former East Berlin). The city broke ground on the new airport in 2006, with the understanding that both Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld would close when it opened.", "The first major sign something was wrong came in summer 2010, when the corporation running construction, the state- and federally-controlled Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg, pushed the opening from October 2011 to June 2012. In 2012, it really did look like the airport would open: the city planned a ceremony which would have been attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

More than 90 metres of cable were incorrectly installed; 4,000 doors were wrongly numbered; escalators were too short. There was such a shortage of check-in desks the planners proposed some airlines check their passengers in at tents in front of the terminal - a move that airlines naturally opposed.", " The city broke ground on the new airport in 2006, with the understanding that both Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld would close when it opened ", "J\u00f6rg Stroedter, the centre-left Social Democrats\u2019 spokesman for the airport committee in Berlin\u2019s parliament, told BBC Capital that errors such as these - and the decision to push forward with fixing them, rather than starting over - are why costs have skyrocketed. The failed opening of the airport in 2012 \u201cshould have led to the decision to totally gut the building and dismantle all the complicated facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that had happened, the airport would have already been in operation for a long time, with newer and less complicated facilities.\u201d", "So is Stroedter's right: why, once so many problems were discovered, didn't Berlin's airport corporation decide to ditch the project and start over? In many ways, it's a classic example of the so-called sunk cost fallacy: people (or in this case, organisations) are often hesitant to cut their losses when they've already invested time or resources into something, even if it might make logical sense to do so. This is a phenomenon not just in high-profile, high-cost projects such this one, but a way of thinking that can often come up in everyday working life as well.", "The longer the delays continued, the more problems inspectors found. Leadership of the planning corporation has changed hands nearly as many times as the opening date has been pushed back. Initially, rather than appointing a general contractor to run the project, the corporation decided to manage it themselves despite not having experience with an undertaking of that scale - a move Fiedler said was the first big mistake that contributed to all the later ones. \u201cIt was a one-in-your-lifetime project for them: they had never dealt with a project of that complexity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in that case, the supervisory council staffed with politicians of course \u2026 couldn\u2019t do the job.\u201d", "To compound the delays, the unused airport is racking up massive costs. Every month it remains unopened costs between \u20ac9m and \u20ac10m, Engelbert L\u00fctke Daldrup, head of the committee running the construction, said earlier this year in response to a parliamentary request. According to the airport corporation, these costs include \u201cconstruction, technical maintenance, facility management and security services\u201d. Approximately 300 to 500 people work regularly in the main terminal building depending on the construction schedule, spokeswoman Kathrin Westh\u00f6lter said.", "\n\n        View image of (Credit: Getty Images)\n    \u00a0", "The cost of cleaning, maintenance, repairs and energy for terminals no passengers have ever flown through is so high that the headlines about it are almost comical. Earlier this year, for example, all 750 of the monitors showing flight information had to be replaced - at a cost of \u20ac500,000 - because they had burned out after years. For months in 2013, a computer glitch meant planners couldn\u2019t turn off the lights in the terminal (this has since been fixed). And empty trains run into the airport\u2019s station every weekday to keep it properly ventilated.", "Westh\u00f6lter says they try to minimise costs wherever possible, but that some ongoing costs are necessary for safety reasons. \u201cAs we are most concerned about minimising costs, we run all equipment on as low [an] energy-level as possible.\u201d\u00a0", "Some have suggested Berlin should simply call it quits and start over. Earlier this year, one Lufthansa executive even predicted the airport would never actually open. \u201cMy prognosis: the thing will be torn down and built anew,\u201d said Thorsten Dirks, head of the airline\u2019s Eurowings budget subsidiary. (Around the same time, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle ran an op-ed saying the same: \u201cTear down Berlin\u2019s unfinished airport and start over!\u201d)", "Assuming all goes well, the airport should open in October 2020. The airport\u2019s planning corporation stood by that estimate as recently as October 2018, despite acknowledging that there are still a \u201cvariety of defects\u201d with the power cable system, as well as power and lighting for the security system. The airport will also have to undergo extensive inspections, slated to begin next year, before it can be opened. \u201cAll the experts tell me there are no shortcomings at BER Airport we can\u2019t fix,\u201d Daldrup told Berlin\u2019s local government in a hearing. \u201cI am convinced that BER will be put into operation in October 2020.\u201d", "\n\n        View image of (Credit: Getty Images)\n    ", "This isn\u2019t the only major infrastructure project that\u2019s gone way over deadline and budget in recent years.

Cement mixtures made from power station waste could turn buildings in to batteries, for example. ", "These potassium-geopolymetric (KGP) composites are cheaper than ordinary cement and can store electricity. A six-metre tall lamp-post made from KGP and equipped with a small solar panel could hold enough energy to power itself throughout the evening, researchers say. ", "\"We have shown that KGP cement mixtures can be used to store and deliver electrical energy without the need for expensive or hazardous additives,\" says Lancaster University professor Mohamed Saafi, who is heading up the research.", "Large numbers of buildings made with KGP could be used to store and release excess energy - smoothing demands on urban electricity grids.", "New materials are also helping to make solar panels cheaper and more cost-effective to make.", "Solar is the most common renewable energy source in cities as costs have continued to tumble - from about \u00a33 a watt a decade ago to 40p a watt now.", "In the UK more than one in three firms is already producing some of their own electricity, mostly using roof-based solar panels. ", "But making silicon-based solar panels is very energy intensive, requiring temperatures of 1,400C and above. The silicon needs to be 99.9999% pure.  ", "But panels made from a class of materials called perovskites can be made much thinner, more cheaply and much lower temperatures, says Nitin Padture, professor of engineering at Brown University in the US. ", "And as they are partially transparent they could also be used for windows.", "The drawback is that most of them contain lead, a toxic metal. But one option Prof Padture and his team are now studying is replacing the lead with titanium. ", "\"Titanium is quite common but no one had thought of using it to replace lead in perovskite solar panels,\" he says.", "\"We're not looking to replace existing silicon technology just yet, but instead we're looking to boost it.\"", "When it comes to wind - the other most common renewable energy source - conventional turbines don't work well in built-up areas because wind directions vary greatly. ", "So researchers Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani have come up a spherical wind turbine to address this problem of varying winds. Their O-Wind turbine, which has now won the UK's 2018 James Dyson Award, is a spherical device that spins when wind hits it from any direction. ", "Another solution from Turkish firm Devici Tech is to use vertical wind turbines along roads where they can be powered by the slipstream from passing traffic.", "It says its Enlil turbines, currently being tested in Istanbul, can handle the power needs of two homes. The turbines can also incorporate solar panels and earthquake sensors, the company says. ", "But not all urban energy-harvesting projects seem to make commercial sense.

It produced 3,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in its first year. ", "But for that money the city could have simply bought 65 million kWh of electricity on the open market.", "Another technology struggling to justify itself commercially is piezo-electricity.", "If you squeeze certain materials such as quartz, you can make electricity flow through them. So cars and lorries trundling along special road surfaces equipped with piezo-electric devices could generate energy. Pedestrians could do this on specially-made pavements.", "In 2009, Israeli firm Innowattech experimented with energy-capturing roads, and now a US firm, Pyro-E is to demonstrate similar technology on a short stretch of road in Fresno, California.", "Yet while it is technically feasible, it is currently prohibitively expensive.", "More Technology of Business", "Some calculate that in the US, a kilometre of a two-way street would need 13,000 piezoelectric devices, adding $400,000 (\u00a3307,000) to construction costs. Even without considering the manufacturing or installation costs, it would take about 12 years to earn back this amount.", "UK firm, Pavegen, has developed electricity-generating pavements that can produce two to four joules of energy with each step you take.", "Its pavements, which cost about \u00a32,350 per sq m, have now been installed in more than 200 locations worldwide, such as transport hubs and shopping centres, the company says.", "That might sound expensive, but then so were solar panels when they first came onto the market.", "\"We believe it's people not technology alone that will transform our cities for the better,\" says Laurence Kemball-Cook, Pavegen's founder and chief executive.", "\"Crucially, we reward people for their interactions via apps.

David approved pictures in a slideshow that I held for him in my hotel room. After the first week of shows, live photographs had to be pretty special to warrant a place in my presentation - in order to maintain his interest. This was one, specifically shot against a wall of people just out of focus.", "\"In the US and Europe, we flew on a private jet, which enabled David and his touring party, including the band, security, wardrobe and photographer, to travel with ease on unusual routes at odd hours. Without it, tour scheduling would be very difficult. However, in Australia we took commercial flights, so a picture of David in a regular seat with an airline meal is a fairly unusual one.

When I first met him, I was very surprised at how far removed he was from the ice-cool persona of the Thin White Duke from his previous tour, in 1978.\"", "\"The shot was made outside Earl Slick's house in Los Angeles. Slick had invited David to his home to meet his family. And, as we walked out, David - very briefly back in the guise of David Bowie - spontaneously jumped behind our car and adopted the pose of the driver of an invisible car. This was so typical of the mime artist that had overwhelmed my senses when he appeared as Ziggy Stardust in 1973 at The Hammersmith Odeon.", "\"Bowie relaxes on the river in Bangkok at the end of the tour. We got up at 03:00 so that a film crew could follow David for the day, discovering older areas of the city as part of the Ricochet documentary.
